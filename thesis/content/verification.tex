\section{Záver}

TODO: we need to compare our method with other methods like LRP or other oclussion methods
TODO: evaluate the consistency of heatmaps, the method several times for the same image and find out if heatmaps are consistent - this way we can find also optimal number of masks
TODO: compare with segmentation masks, if more heat is in important areas
